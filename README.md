## Validations

It can currently validate:

- if your schema is valid JSON or not
- if valid, then run it against [`igluctl lint`](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source/iglu/#lint-1) to further check for errors and inconsistencies against Iglu Schema Registries

### Review comments

Errors are posted as review comments. Some examples are:

**JSON Lint errors**

**Igluctl lint errors**

## Known issues

- This action relies on underlying tools [jsonlint](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint) and [igluctl](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source/iglu/#igluctl) to perform the actual validations. As such, the actual error messages are only as useful as what the tool provides.

  E.g. in the JSON Lint Error screenshot, the problem is an extra trailing comma but the error message from the tool is not so helpful in identifying that.

- Igluctl lint doesn't provide the line numbers of the offending code. This action performs a crude implmentation to figure out the line number. As such, the comments may sometime be placed against incorrect line numbers. If that happens, please feel free to report an _issue_ here. I can not guarantee it can be fixed but I'll definitely try. PRs would be welcome too!

- jsonlint doesn't report all errors at once, so you may have to make multiple passes if your JSON Schema file contains multiple errors.

## Roadmap

[X] - ~~Do not report multiple comments on subsequent runs.~~ Fixed in v1.1.0
